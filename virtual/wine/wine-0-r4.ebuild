DESCRIPTION="Virtual for WINE that supports multiple variants and slotting"

SLOT="0"
KEYWORDS="~amd64 ~x86"
IUSE="staging d3d9"

# Note, the ordering here is intentional, to take advantage of the short-circuit
# logic of portage, to enforce wine-vanilla as default for new users.  The idea
# behind this is that some USE flags may pull in 3rd-party patchsets, so default
# of vanilla prevents that.
