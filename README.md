Welcome to the Wine-a-holics Overlay!
=======================================

Repoman Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NP-Hardass/wine-a-holics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NP-Hardass/wine-a-holics)

Goals
-----
This overlay strives to provide bleeding edge Wine and Wine related ebuilds.
As a sister project of wine-overlay, we aim to improve ebuild quality,
squash bugs, and incorporate the kinds of features that users desire, like
slotted Wine that enables users to use multiple versions of Wine, with and
without Wine-Staging, at the same time.  We know that Wine sometimes includes
regressions from version to version, so the the goal there is to allow you to
switch and use whatever version(s) that your applications need. Additionally,
the non-vanilla versions of wine also support Gallium Nine Direct3D9.
